hi everyone,

Apologies, this is a basic version of the QA Dashboard. Actually I have resigned the company long time back and i forgot to take the download of the Excel copy of QA Dashboard wich I uploaded on youtube. Its difficuly to get it from there because most of the folks i know from there have left the company as it was a very small company.

When I uploaded the Dashboard on Youtube it was just to showcase and since I was working in the company I couldnt release the source code even if it was my baby, I never thought it would become so popular that people will literally ask me for its copy.

But yes, if you seek any help related to the video I can help you with coding.

And also note that the QA Dashboard that I developed 5+ yrs back, was based on Win-7 and VB-6 DLL. It wont work in Win 10 unless you want to code VB in DotNet.

Thanks
QA Rampage
